# 1. Introduction

## Pre-ramble

In my experience, the most daunting obstacle when starting a new hardware project wasn't the system design, requirement definitions or software architecture - it was the headache of choosing the correct components (out from hundreds of thousands of possibilities) to do the job you want of them.

A lot of this comes with experience - the more HW projects you make, the larger your knowledge of coomponent selection will be. You won't need to dig around the catalogues of major distributors to find the exact part you need (and sometimes hope desperately that's in stock) because you'll just pull the design from some previous project and the parts from your shelf.

For someone just starting out, though - that can be a completely different story.

Also, a form of GAS (gear acquisition syndrome - much to the chagrin of their significant others) is common with all EE's, either hobbyists or professional. But for some, having entire rooms, garages, sheds or sections of the house dedicated to the stacks of components to keep on hand just isn't feasible. For those people, having huge boxes filled with 20-year old PIC 16F84A's and venerable 555s or 741's on the off chance you'll need them someday pretty much sucks.

Falling into that second category, I think having a living catalogue of components for most common jobs, ones that are modern and up-to-date, would be a life-saver. Instead of having hundreds of different items in stock, gathering dust, have only tens and still be able to do 80% of everything you want on a whim.  

For the other 20%? What can I say. Dig deep into the filters of Digikey, Mouser or Farnell. Read a book an comb through datasheets. Sacrifice a chicken. It just comes with the territory ;)

## How do we go about it?

We go about it by answering a question: "What are the most common things I'd want to do?" Here are some ideas:
