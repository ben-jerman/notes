# 1. Connectors

1. Terminal Blocks

    These connectors are a very common way to connect wires with larger current-carrying capacity to your PCB. You can use these wires to either power the PCB with an external PSU or interface the PCB with other tech. They mostly come with 5,00 or 5,08 mm pin spacing with multiple options (such as # of positions, some are pluggable, right angle or straight). The most basic (and thus versatile) is the 5,08 mm 2-position non-pluggable screw terminal such as:

    Suggested quantity to purchase: 50 pcs

    Note:
    While generally I won't be recommending that you purchase items from major chinese distributors, terminal blocks might be one of the exceptions. Buying them from official channels can be very pricy and not worth the money. When searching chinese retail sites use keywords "terminal block pcb 5.08", make sure that you're buying from a reputable dealer and perhaps try to be a little conservative with how many amps of current you're trying to push through.
